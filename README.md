# pyodbc_connection

Using the package pyodbc to connect to a database (SQL) by importing it. Also go through using libraries, modules and packages.

## Modules, Libraries and Packages

### Libraries
Refer to python standard libraries.
They come standard with python but need to be imported

### Modules
These are python files/like our Student_Monsters that we import into our programs.
We create and import our own modules internally.

### Packages
These are external modules, that we need to install (externally) and then import them.
These are modules usually written in OOP style, that abstract something.

These things that abstracted include:
- connection to a service (google maps or google image recognition, api, price of stocks, price of bitcoin)
- tools or calculator (prime number calculator, other complex calculators)
- front-end tools - like JS compiler or other things like scss
- full fledged frameworks
- connection to Databases or using HTTP protocols

#### Searching
- google
- look at repos
- previous experience
- https://pypi.org/
- analyse if its maintained and how/why you will use it

#### Installing
- pip - pythons package manager(deals with dependencies and installs in virtual environment, will also probably have to install pip)
- pycharm - you can just add to interpreter

#### Using
- import and call your functions
- follow the documentation
